Test specimens, exposure environments, testing procedures, and field application environments are selected to assure uniform reporting, testing and application of durability strength reduction factors. Two exposure environments are recommended for design, wet and air. Water can diffuse through concrete and accumulate on the epoxy/concrete interface in a wet environment and is the default condition for design. An air environment precludes water accumulation but requires engineering design and validation to guarantee compliance. The resulting durability strength reduction factor may be used to (a) calculate the reduced strength for environmental exposure, (b) qualify a specific CFRP system, (c) compare durability reduction factors to those provided by system suppliers, and (d) confirm compliance with project specifications.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a modeling approach to predict the behavior of timber beams strengthened with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites. A three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) model is formulated, based on the orthotropic constitutive characteristics of timber species. The model provides the load–displacement relationship, strain development, stress concentration, and failure modes of the CFRP-strengthened timber beams and those responses are compared to the experimental data. The validated models are used for a parametric study to further examine the effect of various CFRP properties on the behavior of five timber species: Douglas Fir, Yellow Birch, Sitka Spruce, Yellow Poplar, and Northern White Cedar that cover most of the engineering properties available in practice. The strengthened beams show improved load-carrying capacity and energy absorption capacity when compared to unstrengthened counterparts. An optimal CFRP-reinforcement ratio is found beyond which no strength increase is achieved. Even though the elastic modulus of the CFRP composites influences the failure mode of the strengthened beams, it may not significantly affect the strength-increase of the beams because the properties of timber species are a dominant factor influencing the failure of the beams, rather than the CFRP properties.},

Scale beam testing, with a variety of reinforcement cases, has been performed and the overall results are extremely positive, with test beams showing strong recovery of flexural properties and improvement in the strain to failure.},

The designer must determine the appropriate methods and level of refinement necessary to design and analyze each bridge on a case-by-case basis. The Innovative Bridge Design Handbook: Construction, Rehabilitation, and Maintenance encompasses the state of the art in bridge design, construction, maintenance, and safety assessment. Written by an international group of experts, this book provides innovative design approaches used in various parts of the world and explores concepts in design, construction, and maintenance that will reduce project costs and increase structural safety and durability. Furthermore, research and innovative solutions are described throughout chapters.  The Innovative Bridge Design Handbook: Construction, Rehabilitation, and Maintenance brings together the specific knowledge of a bevy of experts and academics in bridge engineering in the areas of design, assessment, research, and construction. The handbook begins with an analysis of the history and development of bridge aesthetics and design; various types of loads including seismic and wind loads are then described, together with fatigue and fracture. Bridge design based on material such as reinforced concrete, prestressed reinforced concrete, steel and composite, timber, masonry bridges is analyzed and detailed according to international codes and standards. Then bridge design based on geometry, such as arch bridges, girders, cable stayed and suspension bridges, is illustrated. This is followed by a discussion of a number of special topics, including integral, movable, highway and railway bridges, together with seismic component devices, cables, orthotropic decks, foundations, and case studies. Finally, bridge construction equipment, bridge assessment retrofit and management, bridge monitoring, fiber-reinforced polymers to reinforce bridges, bridge collapse issues are covered.

Timber Engineering deals not only with the structural aspects of timber construction, structural components, joints and systems based on solid timber and engineered wood products, but also material behaviour and properties on a wood element level. Produced by internationally renowned experts in the field, this book represents the state of the art in research on the understanding of the material behaviour of solid wood and engineered wood products.  There is no comparable compendium currently available on the topic - the subjects represented include the most recent phenomena of timber engineering and the newest development of practice-related research. Grouped into three different sections, 'Basic properties of wood-based structural elements', 'Design aspects on timber structures' and 'Joints and structural assemblies', this book focuses on key issues in the understanding of:  timber as a modern engineered construction material with controlled and documented properties the background for design of structural systems based on timber and engineered wood products the background for structural design of joints in structural timber systems   Furthermore, this invaluable book contains advanced teaching material for all technical schools and universities involved in timber engineering. It also provides an essential resource for timber engineering students and researchers, as well as practicing structural and civil engineers.},

	abstract = {Traditional timber engineering design approaches use for simple geometries stress- or strain-based criteria for strength analyses. For more complex cases purely empirical methods are also used. Although practical, purely empirical methods are not general, and could lead to estimations on the unsafe side, if extrapolated outside their original scope. It is furthermore known that stress- or strain-based methods are not useful in situations where large stress or strain concentrations arise, such as close to holes or notches, in dowel joints or in glued joints. Furthermore, such phenomena like size effects cannot be predicted, unless stochastic methods are introduced. The paper discusses some fracture mechanics strength analysis methods that in recent years have been proposed in relation to timber engineering strength design. The methods discussed ran e from simple hand calculations based on linear elastic fracture mechanics and useful for simple geometries to finite element analyses for general cases taking into account non-linear performance of the material during fracture. Fracture mechanics results in rational strength design, which is based on mechanics, as opposed to purely empirical methods, and with parameters with a clear physical meaning. In order to obtain material characteristics needed for this approach examples of test methods are discussed. Application examples include structural components, dowel joints and adhesive joints. Design formulae for beams with notches at the support and for the pull out strength of glued-in rods are presented.},

Natural Fibers, Biopolymers, and Biocomposites provides a clear understanding of the present state and the growing utility of biocomposites. Including contributions from experts on biobased materials, the book defines biocomposites and discusses the combination of fibers such as flax, jute, bamboo, pineapple leaf and oil palm fibers, kenaf, and industrial hemp with polymer matrices from both non-renewable and renewable resources. The authors also discuss the chemical nature, testing, biological synthesis, and properties of natural fibers in comparison to traditional materials as well as their cumulative properties when combined with various polymers to produce composite materials that are competitive with synthetic composites. Natural Fibers, Biopolymers, and Biocomposites explains the rise of petrochemical and plastic products, the problems associated in their disposal, and how biopolymers offer a realistic solution to these problems. It analyzes the varying degrees biodegradability in biobased polymers depending on their composition and structure as well as the environment in which they are placed. Subsequent chapters discuss the advantages and applications of biodegradable polymers derived from starch and cellulose, soybeans, and even from renewable resources and petroleum. The authors conclude with recent trends and opportunities for the future use of biocomposites as alternatives to petroleum-based composites. The only source available today that focuses on biobased materials, Natural Fibers, Biopolymers, and Biocomposites integrates the principles of sustainability, industrial ecology, eco-efficiency, and green chemistry and engineering into the development of the next generation of materials, products, and processes.},

The over-riding emphasis is on a clear, simple interpretation of the underlying science, demonstrating how such principles apply to processing operations. The book considers the broad question "what is wood?" by looking at the biology, chemistry and physics of wood structure. Wood quality is examined, and explanations are offered on how and why wood quality varies and the implications for processing. Finally, various "industrial processes" are reviewed and interpreted. All chapters have been written by specialists, but the presentation targets a generalist audience.},
