	Talk about timber being a huge part of structures up until the introduction of concrete. \par
	
	\vspace*{\baselineskip}
	
	\noindent
    Timber has been a dominant material in engineering and construction for many centuries, and continues to be a major material used in housing, floors and furniture. 
    
    However, the use of timber in structures has decreased majorly over the past century due to the introduction of materials such as concrete. This is predominately due to the environmental disadvantages of timber; very combustible, susceptible to severe weathering, maximum life span of 50years, strength limitations; size limitations and insect infestation.

	\section{Literature Review}
	
	\subsection{Timber Bridges}
	Timber has been a dominant material in construction since prehistoric times, and was most likely the first material used to construct a bridge \cite{ritter_timber_1990}. The use of wood as a structural material was prominent throughout the middle ages to the 20th century, where the use for timber in structures declined in the 1960's due to the introduction of steel and concrete \cite{ritter_timber_1990,_timber_2005}. 
	
	\vspace*{\baselineskip}
	
	\noindent
	Timber as a dominant material in structures spanned centuries due to its strength, light-weight, and energy-absorbing properties, which are particularly desirable for bridge construction. Wood has the capability of supporting short-term overloads without any harmful effects to the material. In severe fire exposure, large timber members have fire resistance qualities are equivalent or higher compared to most other materials. Timber is a economically competitive with most other materials as it is naturally grown and lower in cost than materials such as steel and concrete. A major advantage for constructing bridges using timber is its durability in most weather conditions, as long as it is protected from moisture. There is no effect or damage caused to Wood by continuous freezing and thawing, and obtains the ability to resists harmful effects of de-icing agents. This is a huge advantage for the use of timber in bridges as such weather conditions commonly cause deterioration in other bridge materials. The construction of timber bridges is fairly simple and cost effective, as no special equipment is required for installation and can usually be constructed little labour \cite{ritter_timber_1990}. 
	
	\vspace*{\baselineskip}
	
	\noindent
	There have been many bridges built during the 19th century that have lasted over 100 years when they were protected from direct exposure to the elements. Covering wood has become a common practice as it increases the lifespan tremendously, however the use of chemicals to preservative wood has come to light and has been more widely used. By using modern application techniques, chemicals can preserve timber bridges and severely reduce deterioration for over 50 years. This is a major benefit as there is little to no maintenance or painting required for wood treated with preservatives \cite{ritter_timber_1990}.
	
	\vspace*{\baselineskip}
	
	\noindent
	Overall, timber's short term properties and lifespan are desirable for bridge construction. However, in the long-term the life-span of a timber bridge is severely shortened due to its susceptibility to extreme deterioration caused by rotting, weathering and insect attack \cite{_timber_2005,ritter_timber_1990}. Due to these long-term effects, timber bridges require substantial maintenance throughout their structural life \cite{_timber_2005}. Another major issue faced today is that, there is an increasing difficulty in obtaining large sections of wood and sawn timber as tree plantations reduce and the drive for forest preservation increases \cite{_timber_2005,ritter_timber_1990}. 
	
	%% Quick mention of glulam
	
	\vspace*{\baselineskip}
	
	\noindent
	Nowadays, the short life-span, high maintenance requirements and limited supply of timber have ultimately caused the preferred material for bridge construction to veer towards combination of steel and pre-stressed concrete. 

	
	\subsubsection{Structure}
	
	
	\subsubsection{Common Defects and Failures}
	There are four major defects that are commonly occurring in timber bridges; weathering, rotting, cracking and termite infestation. These defects severely reduce the lifespan of a timber bridge and all eventuate to member failure.

    \vspace*{\baselineskip}
    
    \noindent
    \textbf{Weathering and Rotting}

	\noindent
	Weathering and rotting occur in timber members due to exposure to moisture. Both weathering and rotting can lead to major deterioration of the member, reducing the capacity to the point of failure \cite{_timber_2005}. 
    
    \vspace*{\baselineskip}

	\noindent
	Weathering is caused by the environment the timber is exposed to, and can differ in the appearance due to the exposure of different elements. Such as, exposure to high wind speeds can cause dints/abrasions from small pebbles or embedded sand particles \cite{harrowfield_analysis_2006}. The image below shows a form of weathering caused by running water or rain on a rail bridge longitudinal girder.\par
	
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.07]{Weathering}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Weathering}
\end{figure}

	\pagebreak
	
	 \noindent
	 Rotting, on the other hand, commonly occurs in areas that allow moisture to penetrate the wood, such as; the pith or heart (causing core rotting), bolt holes and cut sections (i.e. notches) \cite{_timber_2005,white_bridge_1992}.

	 		\caption{Core and Notch Rotting}
	 	\end{figure}
	 \end{center}  
	
	\noindent
	Rot is decay cause by wood-destroying fungi. The fungi requires adequate moisture, heat and oxygen to prosper and results in two different types of decay, brown rot and white rot. Brown rot is common in softwood, where the fungi attacks only the cellulose creating a brown colour. More common in hardwood, white rot is caused by the fungi attacking both the cellulose and lignin in the wood, creating a white colour. Rotting overall causes a reduction in the strength of the member, colour change, rapid absorption of water, and can make the wood emit an odor similar to anise or wintergreen \cite{white_bridge_1992}

    \vspace*{\baselineskip}
    
    \noindent
    \textbf{Cracking}
    
    \noindent
	Cracking usually occurs due to applied loads exceeding the capacity of the member, and thus will always lead to failure. This defect can occur in any conditions, and is purely dependant on the loads that are applied, however the presents of other capacity reducing defects increases the chances of cracking. The two types of cracks that occur are flexural and shear cracking \cite{_timber_2005}. 
	
    \vspace*{\baselineskip}	
	
	\noindent
	Flexural cracks appear on the areas of a bridge that have high moments due applied loads. The common location for flexural cracking are at mid-span of the member, over the support and underneath any other permanent loads (dead loads). These areas are depicted in the figure below \cite{_timber_2005}.

	\subsection{Notching}
	Notching or sniping is when the lower corner of a member is cut to make insertion easier, as well as to increase the stability of the member when sitting on a pier/abutment etc. Figure X below shows an example of a notched member over a pier.

	\vspace*{\baselineskip}
	
	\noindent
	One of the major issues faced with notches are they significantly reduce the load-carrying and shear capacities of timber beams. For these reasons, it is suggested that the use of notches be avoided in practice, however in some situations they cannot be \cite{jockwer_state---art_2013,jockwer_structural_2014}.

	\subsubsection{Notch Types}
	There are four main types of notching, rectangular end notch, tapered end notch, rounded end notch and notch in span.

	\vspace*{\baselineskip}
	
	% Discuss which types of notches are preferred and why
	\noindent
	Australian Standard AS1720.1 recommends the use of a flat 1:4 gradient slope and the end of the notch, which theoretically increases the shear capacity of the member by 3 times when compares to a "square" notch. However, all references are based on rectangular sections, and do not cover round or octagonal members as are prominent in most rail and road bridges \cite{_timber_2005}.

	\end{center}
	
	\subsubsection{Fracture Mechanics}
	The previous notched member design methods considers predominately the pure effect of the load and does not take into account fracture mechanics. 
	
	\vspace*{\baselineskip}
	
	\noindent
	
	For a beam notched at both ends, Gustafsson proposed a design approach based on fracture energy (Gustafsson 1988). Fracture energy was calculated from the deflection resulting from the moment and shear force action and from an elastic clamping effect, taking into account a lower bending stiffness of the full cross- section at the junction to the notched part of the beam. The resulting additional deflection was assumed to be proportional to the moment acting at the notch corner. By choosing an appropriate value for this clamping effect, a simplification of the resulting expression was possible. Gustafsson looked for a design approach for beams with end notches. Thus, he proposed a verification of shear stresses in the reduced cross-section as given by Eq. (7)
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{figure}[h]
			\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{Geom_notched_beam_dowl}
			\caption{Geometry of notched beam and dowel joint}
		\end{figure}
	\end{center}
	
	\begin{equation}
		\dfrac{V_{f}}{b\alpha d} = \dfrac{\sqrt{\frac{G_{c}}{d}}}{\sqrt{0.6\frac{(\alpha-\alpha^{2})}{G_{xy}}}+\beta\sqrt{6\frac{(1/\alpha-\alpha^2)}{E_{x}}}}
	\end{equation}
	
	
	\noindent
	Where; \par
	$G_{xy}$ - shear modulus\par 
	$ E_{x} $ - modulus of elasticity in beam direction, parallel to the grain\par
	d - depth of the member\par 
	$ G_{c} $ - fracture energy\par 
	$ \beta $, $ \alpha $ and h are depicted in the figure above. \par
	
	\vspace*{\baselineskip}
		
	\noindent
	The fracture energy for a notched member can be found using the following equation. 
	
	\begin{equation}
		 G_{c} = \dfrac{1}{2}(P_{f}^{2}/B) \dfrac{dC(a)}{da} 
	\end{equation}
	
	Where;\par
	C - denotes the compliance of the structure\par
	da - extension of the length of the crack\par
	$P_{f}$ - magnitude of load that start propagation of the crack\par
	B - width of the fracture area (i.e. $B = dA/da$)

	
	
	\vspace*{\baselineskip}
	
	\noindent
	The best prediction of tests results was reached when the clamping effect proposed by Gustafsson (1988) was taken to be proportional to $1/\alpha^{3}$ instead of $1/\alpha^{2}$. Furthermore, Smith et al. (1996b) found Eq. (8) to overestimate the load-carrying capacity of notches of small length, because the stress interaction between notch and support is not taken into account in the underlying theory.

\subsection{Analysis and Modelling}
% How to model timber material using Finite Element Analysis
% How to model with FRP

There are two main failures of notched beams due to loading, the first is flexural failure and the second is cracking at the corner of the notch, along the propagation of the timber fibres. Thus, to model the failure of the beam, we consider both forms of failure separately. 

\vspace*{\baselineskip}

\noindent
Fracture mechanics can be used to determine a theoretical design approach for the notch cracking \cite{jockwer_state---art_2013}

The stress distribution around notches can be described using the continuum theory. The notched beam is modelled as a two-dimensional plate with infinite extension in plane stress or plane strain conditions. Williams (1952) first stated a general approach for the stress distribution at corners of arbitrary angle in isotropic plates. Leicester (1969, 1971) described the extension of the theory to orthotropic material and arbitrary notch angles, resulting in a more complex stress function. Lum and Foschi (1988) gave a general solution of the Airy function for the biharmonic equation, taking into account the different orthogonal stiffness in orthotropic material.

\vspace*{\baselineskip}

In the application of the mean stress method, the
means of stress components, along a predefined area
or length xm in the 2D case are calculated. The mean
values are then used in a traditional stress criterion,
for example a Tsai-Hill or Norris criterion. In the case
of mode I fracture in an isotropic material, such as
high density fibre boards (HDFB), the length xm can
be calculated by means of integrating the stress field
in the vicinity of a crack tip, along a possible crack
growth direction. By setting the mean stress equal to
the material strength one obtains

\begin{equation}
	 x_{m} = \dfrac{2}{\pi} \dfrac{EG_{c}}{f_{t}^{2}}
\end{equation}

Where;
$f_{t}$ - material strength\par
E - Young's modulus\par

In the initial crack method, an initial crack is assumed
to exist at the most stressed point, and oriented in the
direction of predicted crack propagation. The proper
length of the initial crack, ai , is, by theoretical justifications, found to be:

\begin{equation}
	 a_{i} = \dfrac{x_{m}}{2} 
\end{equation}
